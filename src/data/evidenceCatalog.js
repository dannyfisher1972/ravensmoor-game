// Flat list of every hotspot across every room, tagged with its room label.
// Used by the progress counter (total count), the notebook panel (to show
// found evidence with its room of origin), and the deduction board.
//
// Takes the current game's killer name, Victoria's randomized relationship
// status, and this game's murder method, and excludes hotspots exclusive to
// a variant that ISN'T this game's (requires.killer, requires.killerMethod,
// or requires.victoriaStatus set to something else) — those can never be
// found this playthrough, so counting them would make 100% evidence
// impossible and wreck the progress counter and the "Thorough Investigator"
// achievement. requires.optional works the same way, but the exclusion is
// randomized per story slot rather than tied to who the killer is — see
// state.js's isOptionalClueActive — so two different games don't always
// surface the exact same set of atmosphere/red-herring clues.
